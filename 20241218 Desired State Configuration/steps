# Based on the size of the project I choose to use the PUSH method

# On DC install/update the following packages:
Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force
Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force

# create data file that only contains the name of the Servers and the features that will be installed.
# see data.psd1

# Create the share
# the filename is configuration.ps1

# After that I am creating C:\Homework on the DC and copy the files (data.psd1 and configuration.ps1) there
# (it's easier to create the files via VSCode or other IDE)

# Open powershell as administrator:
# win+r -> powershell -> Ctrl + Shift + Enter
# Run the following commands:
Install-Module -Name ComputerManagementDsc
cd C:\Homework
# Source the file configuration.ps1
. .\configuration.ps1
# Call it and add the additional data:
WebServer -ConfigurationData .\data.psd1
Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Web-Server -Wait -Verbose -Force

# To test http://SERVER1 or http://SERVER2
